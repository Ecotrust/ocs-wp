/*theoretically I would move all strings into these files, not just help strings. I would have a mainStrings.json, adminStrings.json and toolStrings.json. mainStrings would be loaded on both admin
and tool pages, then their values combined and overridden by toolStrings.json or adminStrings.json. This will probably be the first step toward localization if I ever get the time.*/
